      The Epic Windbreaker is designed to be your armor against wind and rain
      when hiking in harsh weather conditions. The fabric is light and soft, yet
      sturdy and strong. It really hits the sweet spot between low weight and
      durable toughness. Long underarm ventilation zippers in combination with
      the membrane’s high breathability, makes it easy to obtain an effective
      airflow to transport moisture from the inside of the jacket and out.
      Thoughtful placement of the ventilation zippers also makes it possible to
      wear the jacket like a poncho. A brilliant feature to achieve the optimal
      blend of breathability and protection during intense activity.
