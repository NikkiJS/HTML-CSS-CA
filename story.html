    <p class="story">
      In 1999, Guy McGuyFace had an idea. It wasn't about reinventing the wheel,
      or how to avoid the world's demise in the year 2000. He just wanted people
      to have durable clothing to last them year after year in the rugged
      outdoors.
      <br />
      He wanted people who ventured outside to still feel like they're in their
      Comfort Zone.
      <br />
      Rainy Days was born.
      <br />
      For more than 20 years we've been hard at work, because we know that you
      need the best to be the best.<br />
      Made from high-quality fabrics, our jackets were designed to keep you dry,
      warm, and comfortable. There's nothing Mother Nature can't throw at you.
